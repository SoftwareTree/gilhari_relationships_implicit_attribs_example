# A shell script to invoke some sample curl commands on a Linux machine 
# against a running container image of the app-specific Gilhari microservice 
# gilhari_relationships_implicit_attribs_example:1.0
# 
# The responses are recorded in a log file (curl.log).
#
# Note that these curl commands use a mapped port number of 80
# even though the port number exposed by the app-specific 
# microservice may be different (e.g., 8081) inside the container shell.
# If you want to use these curl commands from inside the
# container shell on the host machine, you may have to use
# the exposed port number (e.g., 8081) instead.
#
# Note: aId is an IMPLICIT attribute in the B object referenced by the aB attrubute of A

# Optional first argument: port number (default 80)
